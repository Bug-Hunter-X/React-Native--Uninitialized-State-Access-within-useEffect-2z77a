This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This commonly happens when using functional components with useState hook, before the component has fully rendered, or in asynchronous operations where the state update hasn't completed yet.  For example:

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Incorrect access to count before it's initialized
    console.log('Initial count:', count); 
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  return (
    <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
  );
}
```
This will log `undefined` because `count` is not yet initialized when `useEffect` is first called.
